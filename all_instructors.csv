In fact, his love of hip hop saw him become the first German rapper to make it to the semi-finals of the ‘Voice of Germany’. Given he’s used to performing on a stage under the bright lights, it’s no wonder he feels so at home in the Peloton studio. As a Peloton Instructor, Cliff’s passion and energy mean you leave his class not only feeling like you’ve had a great workout, but also feeling re-energised and ready to hit all the high notes. Cliff rides in our London studio and does Bike and Bootcamp classes in German.
